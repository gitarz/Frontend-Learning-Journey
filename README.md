# My Front-End Development Journey 🚀

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey in learning front-end development. Here, you'll find various projects where I recreate websites using the skills and techniques I've learned.

## Structure 📚

1. **Imitation Projects**: 
    - Each project is an attempt to imitate a real website, applying the concepts and skills I've recently acquired.
    
2. **Topic-Based Learning**: 
    - I focus on specific topics one at a time, and you'll see how I apply what I've learned through practical tasks.

## Notes 📝

- Some tasks might seem like they could be done more efficiently with newer or easier methods. However, to ensure thorough practice, I stick to the techniques I was learning at that specific time.
